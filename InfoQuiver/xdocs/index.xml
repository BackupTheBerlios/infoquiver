        <p> InfoQuiver will be a server demon, which supports automatic querying and indexing of many kinds of 
            information datasources. It will include build-in support for most diverse information formats and 
            protocols as well as report generation and -dispatching. IQuiver fetches content from defined content 
            sources, stores it in its metaformat in a database and will run user defined searches on the 
            stored content. </p>
        <p> Searchresults will be produced in the form of customizable reports and dispatched for each user, usergroup
            or client. Most of usual transports (HTTP and HTTPS, FTP and SFTP, WEBDAV, SOAP, POP, IMAP, SMPT,
            local file system, CIFS...) and formats (HTML, RSS, PDF as well as various open XML dialects and open office formats)
            are discussed to become medium-term to support. </p>
        <p> InfoQuiver runs on a lot of plattforms as well as with nearly every common database system.
            It uses <a href="http://db.apache.org/torque">Torque</a> as persistence layer with a simplified and 
            powerful, <a 
            href="http://www.manskes.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=71&amp;idcat=32&amp;idcatart=&amp;lang=1">cluster 
            aware caching solution.</a>.            
        </p>
        <p>As for the moment InfoQuiver is in an early development stage even if some of the core services do already 
           work very well.</p>
